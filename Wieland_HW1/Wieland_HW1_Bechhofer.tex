\subsection{Romer 5.8}

\subsubsection*{(a)}

We can start with the full Lagrangian, after substituting

\[
C_t = K_t + Y_t - K_{t+1} =  K_t + A K_t + e_t - K_{t+1}  = (1 + A) K_t + e_t - K_{t+1}
\]
to get
\[
\mathcal{L} = E \left[ \sum_{t=0}^{\infty} \frac{u(C_t) + \lambda_t ((1 + A) K_t + e_t - K_{t+1})}{(1+\rho)^t} \right]
\]

which gives first order conditions with respect to $C_t$ and $K_{t+1}$ (which are chosen each period) of 
\[
u'(C_t) = \lambda_t
\]
and
\[
\lambda_t = \frac{(1+A) E[\lambda_{t+1}]}{(1+\rho)}
\]
and combining gives
\[
u'(C_t) = \frac{(1+A) E[u'(C_{t+1})]}{(1+\rho)}
\]
but since $A=\rho$, we are left with a more standard
\[
u'(C_t) = E[u'(C_{t+1})]
\]
and we can substitute for $u'(C_t)$ since we are given the form of the utility function to get 
\[
u'(C_t) = 1 - 2 \theta C_t
\]
and we now have 
\[
1 - 2 \theta C_t = E[1 - 2 \theta C_{t+1}]
\] 
and from linearity of expectation we can cancel terms to get
\[
C_t = E[C_{t+1}]
\]
as our Euler equation.

\subsubsection*{(b)}

Substituting the guessed form into the resource constraint
\[
C_t = (1 + A) K_t + e_t - K_{t+1}
\]
gets us
\[
\alpha + \beta K_t + \gamma e_t = (1 + A) K_t + e_t - K_{t+1}
\]
and upon rearranging we have
\[
K_{t+1} = (1 + A - \beta) K_t + (1-\gamma) e_t - \alpha
\]
as our function for future capital.

\subsubsection*{(c)}

We have given that 
\[
C_t = \alpha + \beta K_t + \gamma e_t 
\]
so we merely need to find 
\[
E[C_{t+1}] = E[\alpha + \beta K_{t+1} + \gamma e_{t+1}]
\]

By linearity and substituting our earlier result, we have
\[
E[C_{t+1}] = \alpha + \beta ((1 + A - \beta) K_t + (1-\gamma) e_t - \alpha) + \gamma E[e_{t+1}]
\]
Since we are given that $\varepsilon_t$ has expectation zero, we can substitute
\[
E[e_{t+1}] = \phi e_t
\]
(since we are merely applying the law of motion for $e$ in period $t+1$ rather than period $t$) and so we have
\[
E[C_{t+1}] = \alpha + \beta ((1 + A - \beta) K_t + (1-\gamma) e_t - \alpha) + \gamma \phi e_t
\]
which we can simplify as
\[
E[C_{t+1}] = (1 - \beta) \alpha + \beta (1 + A - \beta) K_t + (\beta - \gamma \beta + \gamma \phi) e_t
\]
and from the Euler equation we have
\[
\alpha + \beta K_t + \gamma e_t  = (1 - \beta) \alpha + \beta (1 + A - \beta) K_t + (\beta - \gamma \beta + \gamma \phi) e_t
\]
and so we will have
\begin{align*}
\alpha &= (1 - \beta) \alpha \\
\beta &= \beta (1 + A - \beta) \\
\gamma &= (\beta - \gamma \beta + \gamma \phi)
\end{align*}
which upon solving this system (with 3 equations and 3 unknowns since $A$ and $\phi$ are given) yield
\begin{align*}
\alpha &= 0 \\
\beta &= A\\
\gamma &= \frac{A}{1 + A - \phi}
\end{align*}
for the parameters.

\subsection{Romer 5.9}

\subsubsection*{(a)}

We can start with the full Lagrangian, after substituting

\[
C_t = K_t + Y_t - K_{t+1} =  K_t + A K_t + - K_{t+1}  = (1 + A) K_t - K_{t+1}
\]
to get
\[
\mathcal{L} = E \left[ \sum_{t=0}^{\infty} \frac{u(C_t) + \lambda_t ((1 + A) K_t - K_{t+1})}{(1+\rho)^t} \right]
\]

which gives first order conditions with respect to $C_t$ and $K_{t+1}$ (which are chosen each period) of 
\[
u'(C_t) = \lambda_t
\]
and
\[
\lambda_t = \frac{(1+A) E[\lambda_{t+1}]}{(1+\rho)}
\]
and combining gives
\[
u'(C_t) = \frac{(1+A) E[u'(C_{t+1})]}{(1+\rho)}
\]
but since $A=\rho$, we are left with a more standard
\[
u'(C_t) = E[u'(C_{t+1})]
\]
and we can substitute for $u'(C_t)$ since we are given the form of the utility function to get 
\[
1 - 2 \theta (C_t + v_t) = 1 - 2 \theta (E[C_{t+1}] + E[v_t]) \implies C_t + v_t = E[C_{t+1}] 
\]
from linearity of expectation and the zero mean shock.

\subsubsection*{(b)}

Substituting the guessed form into the resource constraint
\[
C_t = (1 + A) K_t - K_{t+1}
\]
gets us
\[
\alpha + \beta K_t + \gamma v_t = (1 + A) K_t - K_{t+1}
\]
and upon rearranging we have
\[
K_{t+1} = (1 + A - \beta) K_t - \gamma v_t - \alpha
\]
as our function for future capital.

\subsubsection*{(c)}

We have given that 
\[
C_t = \alpha + \beta K_t + \gamma v_t 
\]
so we merely need to find 
\[
E[C_{t+1}] = E[\alpha + \beta K_{t+1} + \gamma v_{t+1}]
\]

By linearity and substituting our earlier result, we have
\[
E[C_{t+1}] = \alpha + \beta ((1 + A - \beta) K_t - \gamma v_t - \alpha) + \gamma E[v_{t+1}]
\]
Since we are given that $v_t$ has expectation zero, we can substitute to obtain
\[
E[C_{t+1}] = \alpha + \beta ((1 + A - \beta) K_t - \gamma v_t - \alpha)
\]
which we can simplify as
\[
E[C_{t+1}] = (1 - \beta) \alpha + \beta (1 + A - \beta) K_t - \gamma \beta v_t
\]
and from the Euler equation we have
\[
\alpha + \beta K_t + (\gamma + 1) v_t  = (1 - \beta) \alpha + \beta (1 + A - \beta) K_t - \gamma \beta v_t
\]
and so we will have
\begin{align*}
\alpha &= (1 - \beta) \alpha \\
\beta &= \beta (1 + A - \beta) \\
\gamma + 1 &= \gamma \beta
\end{align*}
which upon solving this system (with 3 equations and 3 unknowns since $A$ is given) yield 
\begin{align*}
\alpha &= 0 \\
\beta &= A\\
\gamma &= -\frac{1}{1 + A}
\end{align*}
for the parameters.

\subsubsection*{(d)}

Solving for consumption gives
\[
C_t = AK_t - \frac{1}{1 + A} \times v_t
\]
while saving is
\[
K_{t+1} = K_t + \frac{1}{1 + A} \times v_t
\]
and so a one time positive shock means that the capital stock is higher forever (since there is persistence), and this higher capital stock will mean both output and consumption are higher.
