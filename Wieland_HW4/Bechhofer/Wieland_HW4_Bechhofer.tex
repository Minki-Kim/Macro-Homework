\section{Labor supply problem}
\section{Demand shock}

\subsection*{(a)}

The consumption-leisure condition at time $t$ is just equating marginal benefits of labor and leisure $\frac{W_t}{C_t} = v_t L_t^\chi$.

\subsection*{(b)}

The consumer consuming one less unit today means they are losing out on $\frac{1}{C_t}$ today. 
With that, they can buy $\frac{1}{P_t}$ units of capital today, and tomorrow they will get $P_{t+1} + d_{t+1}$ from that unit of capital. 
So their payoff tomorrow is 
\[
\frac{1}{P_t} \times (P_{t+1} + d_{t+1}) \times \frac{\beta}{C_{t+1}}
\]
and optimality therefore implies we have
\[
\frac{1}{C_t} = \frac{1}{P_t} \times (P_{t+1} + d_{t+1}) \times \frac{\beta}{C_{t+1}}
\]
as the inter-temporal optimality condition.

\subsection*{(c)}



\section{Business cycle and external returns to scale}

\subsection*{(a)}

Each firm sets wage equal to marginal product of labor, so we have
\[
W_t = Y_t^{1-1/\gamma} \left(\frac{K_{it}}{L_{it}}\right)^{\alpha} Z_t^{1-\alpha}
\]
and so we can find labor demand as a function of wages
\[
L_{it} = (W_t Z_t^{\alpha-1} Y_t^{1/\gamma -1} K_{it}^{-\alpha})^{-\frac{1}{\alpha}}
\]
which simplifies to
\[
L_{it} = W_t^{-\frac{1}{\alpha}} Z_t^{\frac{1-\alpha}{\alpha}} Y_t^{\frac{1-1/\gamma}{\alpha}} K_{it}
\]

\subsection*{(b)}

Integrating both sides over all firms, we have
\[
L_t = W_t^{-\frac{1}{\alpha}} Z_t^{\frac{1-\alpha}{\alpha}} Y_t^{\frac{1-1/\gamma}{\alpha}} K_t
\]
so we can start to solve for aggregate production, so we get
\[
Y_t^{\frac{1-1/\gamma}{\alpha}} = \frac{L_t}{K_t} \times W_t^{\frac{1}{\alpha}} Z_t^{\frac{\alpha - 1}{\alpha}}
\]
and solving for $Y$ gives
\[
Y_t = \left(\frac{L_t}{K_t} \right)^{\frac{\alpha}{1-1/\gamma}} W_t^{\frac{1}{1-1/\gamma}} Z_t^{\frac{\alpha - 1}{1-1/\gamma}}
\]



\section{Problems from Romer}
\subsection{Problem 6.10}

\subsection{Problem 6.11}

\subsection{Problem 6.12}

\subsubsection*{(a)}
First, we can substitute our wage expression $w = \theta p$ to get
\[
p = \theta p + (1-\alpha) \ell - s \implies p = \frac{(1-\alpha) \ell - s}{1-\theta}
\]
and we are given aggregate demand, so we have
\[
y = m - p = m - \frac{(1-\alpha) \ell - s}{1-\theta}
\]
and from our output equation we have
\[
s + \alpha \ell = m - \frac{(1-\alpha) \ell - s}{1-\theta} \implies \ell = \frac{(1-\theta) m + \theta s}{1-\theta \alpha}
\]
which we can substitute into our price equation to get
\[
p = \frac{(1-\theta) m - s}{1-\theta \alpha}
\]
and now we have our output
\[
y = \frac{(1-\theta) \alpha m + s}{1-\theta \alpha}
\]
and we can find wage using the original wage expression to get
\[
w = \theta \times \frac{(1-\theta) m - s}{1-\theta \alpha}
\]
and we can now find how employment responds to shocks.

We can take mixed second derivatives to obtain
\[
\frac{\partial^2 \ell}{\partial m \partial \theta} = \frac{\alpha - 1}{(1-\theta \alpha)^2}
\]
for how indexation moderates the effect of a monetary shock and
\[
\frac{\partial^2 \ell}{\partial s \partial \theta} = \frac{1}{(1-\theta \alpha)^2}
\]
for how indexation moderates the effect of a supply shock.

Since $\alpha - 1 < 0$, we have that greater indexation reduces the effect of a monetary shock, while $1 > 0$ tell us that greater indexation scales the effects of supply shocks up.

\subsubsection*{(b)}

With independence we can just use the formula for the variance of a linear combination of two random variables. So we have
\[
\operatorname{Var}(\ell) = \left(\frac{1-\theta}{1-\theta \alpha}\right)^2 \operatorname{Var}(m) + \left(\frac{\theta}{1-\theta \alpha}\right)^2 \operatorname{Var}(s)
\]
so minimizing this requires the first order condition
\[
(1-\theta)(\alpha-1) \operatorname{Var}(m) + \theta \operatorname{Var}(s)
\]
so solving for $\theta$ we get
\[
\theta^* = \frac{(1-\alpha) \operatorname{Var}(m)}{(1-\alpha) \operatorname{Var}(m) + \operatorname{Var}(s)}
\]
as the wage indexation that minimizes employment variance.
