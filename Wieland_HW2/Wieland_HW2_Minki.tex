\section{Investment and the Housing Market}
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
	\item Explain the model 
\begin{enumerate}
	\item $I = \psi (P)$: Gross investment in housing is an increasing function of the price of houses. This specification implies that housing investment can be interpreted as a supply of new housings. 
	\item $r + \delta = (R + \dot{P})/P$: I assume that $\delta$ denotes the depreciation rate of a house. LHS is opportunity costs of investing into a house: forgone real interest rate and depreciation of the house. RHS is benefits of investing into a house: (real) rental payment and capital gains from the price of house. 
	\item $R = R(H)$: Rental cost $R$ is a decreasing function of available quantity of housing stock. 
	\item $\dot{H} = I - \delta H$: Change in $H$ is the difference between housing investment (new housing) and depreciated housing stock. 
\end{enumerate}
The model is closed: it has 4 endogenous variables ($I,R,P,H$) with 4 equations.

\item Reduce the model into a 2-equation system
\begin{align*}
\dot{H} &= \psi(P) - \delta H \\
r + \delta &= (R(H) + \dot{P}) / P
\end{align*}
Here $R$ is a function, not a variable. 
\item Draw phase diagram. 
*Lines do not have to be linear.

	\includegraphics[width=0.65\textwidth]{1c_Minki.png}
	\caption{Phase diagram for the housing market}
\end{figure}
\item Steady state effect of an increase in the real interest rate
$r$ only shows up in the equation for $\dot{P}$. Rewriting the equation: 
\begin{equation*}
\dot{P} + R(H) = P (r + \delta)
\end{equation*}
Given a level of $P$, an increase in $r$ makes RHS larger, requiring $R(H)$ getting larger by the same amount to satisfy $\dot{P} = 0$. Since $R$ is a decreasing function of $H$, it means that $H$ has to decrease. Hence, $\dot{P} = 0$ locus shifts to the left. 

\item Permanent increase in the real interest rate. Suppose the real interest rate changes from $r$ to $r^{*}$, where $r < r^{*}$. Recall that in the initial steady state, $P = \frac{R(H)}{r+\delta}$. At the arrival of the change, $P$ drops to the level $\frac{R(H)}{r^{*} + \delta}$. Cheaper real price of housing assets (or higher opportunity cost of investing in housing) reduces the amount of housing investments. As the housing investment decreases, the quantity of housing stock gradually decreases, until $R(H)$ goes up enough to satisfy $\dot{P}=0$ again.

\section{Discount Factor Shock}
Time-varying discount factor is being incorporated in the model through the Euler equation. Below is the model developed in the class with time-varying discount factor. 
\begin{align*}
\lambda_t &= \frac{1}{C_t} \\
\frac{C_{t+1}}{C_t} &=  \mathbb{E}_t \beta_{t+1} (1+ R_{t+1})\\
W_t &= (1-\alpha) Z_t \left( \frac{K_{t-1}}{L_t} \right)^\alpha \\
R_t + \delta & = \alpha Z_t \left( \frac{K_{t-1}}{L_t} \right)^{\alpha-1} \\
L_t^{\frac{1}{\eta}} C_t &= W_t \\
C_t + I_t + G_t &= Z_t L_t \left(\frac{K_{t-1}}{L_t} \right)^\alpha \\
K_t &= (1-\delta) K_{t-1} + I_t
\end{align*}

The model has seven endogenous variables ($\lambda_t, K_t, W_t, C_t, L_t, R_t, I_t$ ) and three exogenous variables ($\beta_t, Z_t, G_t)$. We can also reduce the model into a 2-equation system. A log-linearized version of the system is as follows:

\begin{align*}
\Delta \check{K_t} &= \frac{\bar{Y}}{\bar{K}} \left( 1 + \frac{1-\alpha}{\alpha + 1/\eta} \right) \check{Z_t} + \left( \frac{\alpha (1-\alpha )}{\alpha + 1/\eta}  \frac{\bar{Y_t}}{\bar{K_t}}  + \alpha \frac{\bar{Y}}{\bar{K}} - \delta  \right) \check{K_{t-1}}  \\
&+ \left( \frac{\bar{C}}{\bar{K}} + \frac{\bar{Y}}{\bar{K}} \frac{(1-\alpha)}{\alpha + 1/\eta}\right) \check{\lambda_t} - \frac{\bar{G}}{\bar{K}}\check{G_t} \\
\Delta \check{\lambda_{t+1}}  &=  - \check{\beta_{t+1}} - \frac{\alpha \frac{\bar{Y}}{\bar{K}}}{\alpha \frac{\bar{Y}}{\bar{K}} + 1 - \delta} \left[   \left( 1 + \frac{1-\alpha}{\alpha + 1/\eta} \right) \check{Z_{t+1}} + (1-\alpha) \left( \frac{\alpha}{1/\eta + \alpha} -1 \right) \check{K_t} + \frac{1-\alpha}{1/\eta + \alpha} \check{\lambda_{t+1}}  \right]
\end{align*}

By setting $\Delta \lambda_t = 0$, we have the locus of points where the marginal utility of wealth is not changing.
\paragraph{\bf Locus $\Delta \lambda_t = 0$} 
\begin{equation*}
\check{\lambda_{t+1}} = -  \frac{1/\eta + \alpha}{1-\alpha} \left[  \left( \frac{\alpha \frac{\bar{Y}}{\bar{K}}}{\alpha \frac{\bar{Y}}{\bar{K}} + 1 - \delta} \right)^{-1} \check{\beta_{t+1}} +  \left( 1 + \frac{1-\alpha}{\alpha + 1/\eta} \right) \check{Z_{t+1}} + (1-\alpha) \left( \frac{\alpha}{1/\eta + \alpha} -1 \right) \check{K_t} \right] 
\end{equation*}

Since $\check{\beta_t}$ does not change the slope of the $\Delta \lambda_t$ locus, the phase diagram for this economy is similar to the one we drew in class. 

\paragraph{ \bf Permanant discount factor shocks}
The increase in the discount factor means that agents become more patient - they value future utility relatively more than before. This means that they want to consume less in the present period and more in the future, relative to those people with lower discount rate. 
\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{2_1_Minki.png}
	\caption{Response to permanent discount factor shock}
\end{figure}
In response to the shock, marginal utility jumps up to the new stable arm, inducing higher labor supply and investment along with lower consumption. Marginal utility and investments gradually decrease as the economy approaches to the new steady state, chracterized by a higher capital stock and steady state consumption level. With more capital stock being accumulated, labor demand also increases, building up higher aggregate labor as well as output. Steady state wage is higher than the wage before the shock, since steady state interest rate is lowered ($\because R = \frac{1}{\beta}$). This implies that labor demand reacts more aggresively relative to labor supply. Transition paths for each variable are summarized in the table below. 
\begin{table}[H]
	\centering
	\begin{tabular}{cccc}
		\hline \hline 
		& Impact  & Transition            & Steady State \\
		& $t=t_0$ & $t \in (t_0, \infty)$ & $t = \infty$ \\

		\hline
	\end{tabular}
	\caption{Response to a permanent discount factor shock}
\end{table}
\paragraph{\bf Transitory discount factor shocks}
In response to a transitory discount factor shock, marginal utility jumps up just to make sure to land on the initial stable arm when the shock disappears at $t= t_1$. 
\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{2_2_Minki.png}
	\caption{Response to transitory discount factor shock}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{2_3_Minki.png}
	\caption{Labor market response to transitory discount factor shock}
\end{figure}
At the time of shock $(t_0)$, $\lambda$ jumps up, inducing higher labor supply and lower consumption. Higher output with less consumption means higher investment, followed by a larger stock of capital. Higher labor supply induces lower real wage, and with no change in productivity it means that higher real interest rate (FPPF argument). 

In constrast to a permanent shock, the economy accumulates more capital only to support temporarily higher consumption level while the shock persists. In the course of the period that the shock is effective, households gradually increase their consumption and decrease labor supply, eating up the capital they accumulated earlier. This is demonstrated in the above labor supply curve. Since labor demand also increases due to the higher capital stock, the effect of a transitory discount shock on aggregate labor (hence output) largely depends on the elasticity of labor supply and labor demand.  

After period $t_1$, the economy follows the initial stable arm and returns to the initial steady state. Consumption goes back to its initial level, along with higher labor supply to support it. Since we can't sign aggregarte labor, we can't use production function to sign output. However, Using $Y = C+ I$ we can back out the sign of $Y$. Transition dynamics are summarized in the table below.

\section{(Noise) News Shock}
\section{Labor Supply}
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
	\item Since the path of the wage rate $w_t$ is known at $t=0$, there is no uncertainty in the economy. To prepare for the days when $w_t$ level is not high enough to compensate the consumption level $C$ she would like to spend every period, she has to save some fraction of her income. Let the saving in period $t$ be $S_t$. Her intertemporal and lifetime budget constraints are written as follows: 
	\begin{align*}
	C + S_t &= w_t N_t + S_{t-1} \\
	\sum_{t=0}^{T} w_t N_t & = C \times T
	\end{align*} Now set up a Lagrangian: 
	\begin{equation*}
	\mathcal{L} = \sum_{t=0}^{T}  \left[ \ln (1+ N_t) + \lambda_t \left(C + S_t - w_t N_t - S_{t-1} \right) \right] + \psi \sum_{t=0}^{T} \left( w_t N_t - C \cdot T\right)  
	\end{equation*}
    First order conditions for $S_t$ and $N_t$ are: 
    \begin{align*}
    \lambda_t &= \lambda_{t+1} \\
    \frac{1}{1+N_t} + \psi w_t &= \lambda_t w_t 
    \end{align*}
    Combining the above two equations gives us the Euler equation: 
    \begin{equation*}
    w_t (1+ N_t) = w_{t+1} (1+N_{t+1})
    \end{equation*}
    \item Rearrage the Euler equation: 
    \begin{equation*}
    \frac{w_{t+1}}{w_t} = \frac{1+N_t}{1+ N_{t+1}} = \frac{\text{Marginal disutility of labor in period $t+1$ } (MU_{t+1}) }{\text{Marginal disutility of labor in period $t$ } (MU_t) }
    \end{equation*}
    If wage goes up in current period, either $MU_t$ goes up or $MU_{t+1}$ goes down, which means the individual either works more in this period to take advantage of the higher wage, or work less in the next period using up increased savings accumulated in period $t$.
